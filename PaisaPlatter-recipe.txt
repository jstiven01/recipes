Ingredients
(4 Servings)

 -1 Recipe Paisa Pinto Beans (Frijoles Paisas)
 -1 Recipe white Rice (Arroz Blanco)
 -1 Recipe Powdered Beef (Carne en Polvo)
 -4 Fried Pork Belly (Chicharrones)
 -4 Cooked Chorizos
 -4 Fried eggs sunny side up
 -4 baked plantainsor Tajadas de Pl√°tano
 -1 Recipe Hogao
 -Lime and Avocado for Serving

Directions:
1. Prepare the beans, hogao and powdered beef one day ahead and keep in the refrigerator.
2. When you are going to serve the bandeja paisa, heat the beans and powdered beefand hogao. Make the chicharrones.
3. Cook the white rice and plantains.
4. Fry the eggs and chorizos.
5. To serve, place the rice in a tray or platter and place the rest of the ingredients as you like. I prefer the beans in a separate bowl, 
   but you can ladle the beans next to the rice if you like.
6. Bring the hogao in a serving dish to the table, so people can place it on top of the beans if they like. Enjoy!
